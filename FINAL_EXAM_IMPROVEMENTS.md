  exam_type VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  exam_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
  score INTEGER NOT NULL,
  total_questions INTEGER NOT NULL,
  correct_answers INTEGER NOT NULL,
  time_spent INTEGER NOT NULL,
  completed_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

### User Experience Flow

   - **"Refaire"**: Deletes old result and starts fresh exam
