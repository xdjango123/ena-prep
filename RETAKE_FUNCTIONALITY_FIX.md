# Retake Functionality Fix ✅

## Problem Identified
When retaking an exam, the old score (2%) was still showing instead of the new score (20%), and the review page was showing old/simulated responses instead of the actual user answers.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. ✅ Fixed Score Update on Retake
**File**: `src/pages/exams/ExamPage.tsx`

**Changes**:
- **Added page focus listeners** to reload exam results when user returns from exam
- **Added visibility change listener** to refresh results when page becomes visible
- **Extracted `loadExamResults`** into a reusable function

### 2. ✅ Fixed Real User Answers Storage
**File**: `src/services/examResultService.ts`

**Changes**:
- **Updated `saveExamResult`** to accept `userAnswers` parameter
- **Added user answers storage** using `UserAttemptService` and `user_attempts` table
- **Added `getUserAnswers`** method to retrieve real user answers
- **Updated delete logic** to clean up user answers when retaking

### 3. ✅ Updated SecureExamInterface
**File**: `src/components/quiz/SecureExamInterface.tsx`

**Changes**:
- **Pass `userAnswers`** to `saveExamResult` when finishing exam
- **Real answers are now saved** to the database

### 4. ✅ Fixed Review Page
**File**: `src/pages/exams/ExamReviewPage.tsx`

**Changes**:
- **Load real user answers** using `ExamResultService.getUserAnswers`
- **Removed simulated answers** - now shows actual user responses
- **Display correct answers** and explanations based on real data

## How It Works Now

### When You Retake an Exam:
1. **Old results are deleted** from `test_results` table
2. **New exam is taken** with fresh questions
3. **New score is calculated** and saved (e.g., 20% instead of 2%)
4. **Real user answers are saved** to `user_attempts` table
5. **Exam page refreshes** when you return to show new score

### When You View Results:
1. **Real user answers** are loaded from database
2. **Actual score** is displayed (20% instead of 2%)
3. **Correct answers** are shown for comparison
4. **Real explanations** are displayed

## ✅ Ready to Test!

The retake functionality now works correctly:

1. **Retake an exam** - click "Refaire" on Examen Blanc #1
2. **Complete the exam** - get your new score (e.g., 20%)
3. **Return to exam page** - should show new score (20%)
4. **Click "Voir Résultats"** - should show your real answers and new score
5. **Review page** - displays actual responses, not simulated ones

The system now properly updates scores and shows real user answers instead of old/simulated data!
