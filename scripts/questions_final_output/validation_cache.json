      "WRONG_ANSWER (OpenAI): En français, l'usage de la virgule avant 'et' est généralement incorrect sauf pour des raisons stylistiques ou pour éviter une ambiguïté. Dans l'option 1, la virgule avant 'et' est incorrecte. L'option 2 utilise correctement la virgule pour séparer les éléments d'une énumération. L'option 3 est incorrecte car elle utilise un point-virgule de manière inappropriée après une virgule. Ainsi, l'option 2 est la seule qui respecte les règles standard de ponctuation en français.",
      "WRONG_ANSWER (Gemini): Analyse des options :\n1.  'Il est venu, et a pris son sac.' : En français, on n'utilise généralement pas de virgule avant 'et' lorsque cette conjonction relie deux propositions ayant le même sujet et qui sont de courte taille ou étroitement liées. La virgule ici est donc incorrecte ou du moins non standard.\n2.  'Il n’est ni mon père, ni mon frère, ni mon oncle.' : Lorsque la conjonction 'ni' est répétée pour énumérer plusieurs éléments, les virgules sont correctement utilisées pour séparer ces éléments, de la même manière qu'une énumération avec 'et' ou 'ou'. C'est un usage correct de la virgule.\n3.  'Fatiguée, elle est ; très malade.' : L'utilisation du point-virgule ici est incorrecte. Un point-virgule sépare des propositions indépendantes mais liées par le sens, ou des éléments complexes dans une énumération. 'Très malade' n'est pas une proposition indépendante. La structure de la phrase est également maladroite.\n\nConclusion : L'option 2 est la seule qui présente un usage correct de la virgule selon les règles de la grammaire française. La réponse marquée comme correcte (Option 1) est incorrecte."

      "WRONG_ANSWER: Marked option 2, OpenAI suggests option 3, Gemini suggests option 1",
      "WRONG_ANSWER (OpenAI): La séquence de formes est: triangle pointe en haut, carré, triangle pointe en bas, cercle. La séquence de couleurs est: Rouge, Jaune, Vert, Bleu. La première figure est un triangle rouge pointe en haut. En suivant la séquence, la deuxième figure est un carré jaune, la troisième est un triangle vert pointe en bas, et la quatrième est un cercle bleu. La séquence se répète, donc la cinquième figure serait un triangle rouge pointe en haut, la sixième un carré jaune, la septième un triangle vert pointe en bas, et la huitième un cercle bleu. Ainsi, la neuvième figure, qui suit le cercle bleu, serait un triangle rouge pointe en haut. Cependant, la question demande la figure qui suit immédiatement après le cercle bleu, ce qui est un triangle rouge pointe en haut. Mais si nous considérons la séquence de couleurs, après le cercle bleu, la prochaine couleur pour le carré serait rouge. Donc, la bonne réponse est un carré bleu, qui est l'option 3.",
      "WRONG_ANSWER (Gemini): L'analyse de la séquence est la suivante:\n\n1.  **Séquence des formes:** triangle pointe en haut (S1), carré (S2), triangle pointe en bas (S3), cercle (S4). Cette séquence se répète.\n2.  **Séquence des couleurs:** Rouge (C1), Jaune (C2), Vert (C3), Bleu (C4). Cette séquence se répète.\n3.  **Combinaison:** La question indique que \"La première figure est un triangle rouge pointe en haut\", ce qui signifie que la première forme (S1) est associée à la première couleur (C1). En suivant cette logique pour la répétition, chaque forme est associée à la couleur correspondante dans la séquence.\n\nLa séquence complète est donc:\n*   1ère figure: (S1, C1) = Triangle Rouge pointe en haut\n*   2ème figure: (S2, C2) = Carré Jaune\n*   3ème figure: (S3, C3) = Triangle Vert pointe en bas\n*   4ème figure: (S4, C4) = Cercle Bleu\n\nLa question demande quelle figure \"complète logiquement la séquence\", ce qui signifie la prochaine figure dans la séquence. La 5ème figure serait donc la répétition de la 1ère figure:\n*   5ème figure: (S1, C1) = Triangle Rouge pointe en haut\n\nMaintenant, évaluons les options:\n*   **Option 1: Cercle Vert** (S4, C3) - Incorrect. Le cercle (S4) est toujours associé au Bleu (C4). Le Vert (C3) est toujours associé au triangle pointe en bas (S3).\n*   **Option 2: Triangle Jaune pointe en bas** (S3, C2) - Incorrect. Le triangle pointe en bas (S3) est toujours associé au Vert (C3). Le Jaune (C2) est toujours associé au carré (S2). Cette option est la réponse marquée comme correcte, mais elle est logiquement impossible selon les règles établies.\n*   **Option 3: Carré Bleu** (S2, C4) - Incorrect. Le carré (S2) est toujours associé au Jaune (C2). Le Bleu (C4) est toujours associé au cercle (S4).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nLa figure qui complète logiquement la séquence est \"Triangle Rouge pointe en haut\". Cependant, cette option n'est pas proposée parmi les choix. De plus, aucune des options proposées ne représente une combinaison valide de forme et de couleur selon les règles de la séquence. Par conséquent, la réponse marquée comme correcte (Option 2) est incorrecte, et toutes les options sont incorrectes. J'ai choisi l'option 1 comme 'actual_correct_option' pour satisfaire le format JSON, mais il est important de noter qu'aucune des options n'est correcte."

Order the finalists alphabetically: \n   1. Ama\n   2. Kouassi\n   3. Yao\n4. Determine the winner's position: The rule states to use the unit digit (5) as the position in the alphabetical order. Since there are only 3 finalists, the position must wrap around (modulo operation).\n   Using 1-based indexing for the list: (Position - 1) mod (Number of finalists) + 1\n   (5 - 1) mod 3 + 1 = 4 mod 3 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.\n   The winner is at the 2nd position in the alphabetical list.\n5.

La seule configuration qui respecte ces conditions est Koffi, Yao, Ahou. Ainsi, l'option correcte est 2: 'Koffi, Yao, Ahou'.",

Avec seulement trois personnes autour d'une table ronde, chaque personne est adjacente aux deux autres. Il est donc impossible de satisfaire cette contrainte. Nous devons supposer qu'il s'agit d'une préférence qui ne peut être satisfaite ou d'un élément perturbateur, et donner la priorité aux règles strictes.\n3.  **Contrainte 2 (Stricte) :** Koffi insiste pour être assis à droite de celui qui a les yeux les plus perçants.\n4.  **Fait :** Ahou a les yeux les plus perçants.\n\nDéduction :\n*   D'après la Contrainte 2 et le Fait, Koffi doit être assis à droite d'Ahou.\n*   En supposant que 'à droite de' signifie la personne suivante dans le sens des aiguilles d'une montre (standard pour les arrangements de table).\n\n1.

La seule personne restante est Yao (Y). Elle doit occuper la dernière place.\n4.  L'arrangement complet dans le sens des aiguilles d'une montre est donc : Ahou, Koffi, Yao.\n\nVérification de cet arrangement :\n*   **Ahou, Koffi, Yao (dans le sens des aiguilles d'une montre)**\n    *   **Contrainte 2 (Koffi à droite d'Ahou) :** Oui, Koffi est immédiatement après Ahou dans le sens des aiguilles d'une montre. (Satisfaite)\n    *   **Contrainte 1 (Ahou pas à côté de Yao) :** Dans cet arrangement, Ahou est à côté de Koffi, Koffi est à côté de Yao, et Yao est à côté d'Ahou (en raison de la circularité). Donc, Ahou est bien à côté de Yao. Comme mentionné, cette contrainte ne peut être satisfaite avec 3 personnes.\n\nLa question demande l'ordre des sièges 'dans le sens des aiguilles d'une montre, en commençant par Koffi'.\nNotre ordre dérivé est : Ahou, Koffi, Yao.\nEn commençant par Koffi, l'ordre est : Koffi, Yao, Ahou.\nCeci correspond à l'Option 2.\n\nAnalyse de la réponse marquée (Option 1 : Koffi, Ahou, Yao) :\nSi l'ordre est Koffi, Ahou, Yao (dans le sens des aiguilles d'une montre) :\n*   Koffi (K)\n*   Ahou (A)\n*   Yao (Y)\n\nDans cet arrangement, la personne à droite d'Ahou (dans le sens des aiguilles d'une montre) est Yao. Koffi est à gauche d'Ahou.

      "WRONG_ANSWER (OpenAI): Pour identifier correctement le contenu de toutes les boîtes, Aminata doit tirer un pagne de la boîte étiquetée 'Mixte'. Puisque toutes les boîtes sont mal étiquetées, la boîte étiquetée 'Mixte' ne peut pas contenir un mélange. Si elle tire un pagne bleu, cela signifie que cette boîte contient uniquement des pagnes bleus. Par conséquent, la boîte étiquetée 'Rouges' doit contenir le mélange (puisqu'elle ne peut pas contenir uniquement des rouges), et la boîte étiquetée 'Bleus' doit contenir uniquement des pagnes rouges. Ainsi, la bonne option est 3, la boîte étiquetée 'Mixte'.",
      "WRONG_ANSWER (Gemini): Ce problème est une énigme classique. Aminata sait qu'il y a trois boîtes (Bleus, Rouges, Mixte) et que toutes les étiquettes sont incorrectes. Elle ne connaît pas la configuration spécifique des erreurs d'étiquetage (par exemple, que l'étiquette 'Bleus' est sur la boîte Mixte), car si elle le savait, elle n'aurait pas besoin de tirer un pagne.\n\nL'objectif est de choisir une boîte dont le tirage d'un seul pagne permettra d'identifier le contenu de TOUTES les boîtes, quelle que soit la couleur du pagne tiré.\n\nAnalysons chaque option :\n\n1.  **La boîte étiquetée \"Bleus\" (Option 1) :**\n    *   Aminata sait que cette boîte ne peut pas contenir uniquement des pagnes bleus (car l'étiquette est incorrecte).\n    *   Donc, elle contient soit des pagnes rouges, soit un mélange.\n    *   Si elle tire un pagne bleu : Elle sait que la boîte ne peut pas contenir uniquement des pagnes rouges. Puisqu'elle ne peut pas non plus contenir uniquement des pagnes bleus (étiquette incorrecte), elle doit contenir un mélange.\n    *   Si elle tire un pagne rouge : Elle sait que la boîte ne peut pas contenir uniquement des pagnes bleus. Cependant, elle pourrait contenir uniquement des pagnes rouges OU un mélange. Elle ne peut pas distinguer entre ces deux possibilités avec un seul tirage. Par conséquent, choisir cette boîte ne garantit pas l'identification.\n\n2.  **La boîte étiquetée \"Rouges\" (Option 2) :**\n    *   Aminata sait que cette boîte ne peut pas contenir uniquement des pagnes rouges (car l'étiquette est incorrecte).\n    *   Donc, elle contient soit des pagnes bleus, soit un mélange.\n    *   Si elle tire un pagne rouge : Elle sait que la boîte ne peut pas contenir uniquement des pagnes bleus. Puisqu'elle ne peut pas non plus contenir uniquement des pagnes rouges (étiquette incorrecte), elle doit contenir un mélange.\n    *   Si elle tire un pagne bleu : Elle sait que la boîte ne peut pas contenir uniquement des pagnes rouges. Cependant, elle pourrait contenir uniquement des pagnes bleus OU un mélange. Elle ne peut pas distinguer entre ces deux possibilités avec un seul tirage. Par conséquent, choisir cette boîte ne garantit pas l'identification.\n\n3.  **La boîte étiquetée \"Mixte\" (Option 3) :**\n    *   Aminata sait que cette boîte ne peut pas contenir un mélange (car l'étiquette est incorrecte).\n    *   Donc, elle contient soit uniquement des pagnes bleus, soit uniquement des pagnes rouges.\n    *   Si elle tire un pagne bleu : Elle sait que la boîte ne peut pas être un mélange (étiquette incorrecte) et ne peut pas contenir uniquement des pagnes rouges (elle a tiré un bleu). Donc, la boîte doit contenir uniquement des pagnes bleus.\n    *   Si elle tire un pagne rouge : Elle sait que la boîte ne peut pas être un mélange (étiquette incorrecte) et ne peut pas contenir uniquement des pagnes bleus (elle a tiré un rouge). Donc, la boîte doit contenir uniquement des pagnes rouges.\n    *   Dans les deux cas (tirer un bleu ou un rouge), Aminata identifie de manière unique le contenu de la boîte étiquetée \"Mixte\". Une fois cette boîte identifiée, elle peut déduire le contenu des deux autres boîtes en utilisant la règle des étiquettes incorrectes et par élimination.\n\nPar conséquent, la seule boîte qui garantit l'identification correcte de toutes les boîtes, quel que soit le pagne tiré, est celle étiquetée \"Mixte\"."

Après un losange noir, un carré blanc, et un cercle noir, la logique suggère que la prochaine forme devrait être un carré noir pour continuer l'alternance de couleurs et de formes.

La progression logique est une alternance, donc la couleur suivante devrait être **Blanc**.\n    *   Ceci élimine l'Option 3 (Carré noir) car sa couleur est noire.\n\n2.  **Motif de forme :** La séquence des formes est Losange, Carré, Cercle. La progression la plus logique pour une séquence de trois éléments est un cycle de répétition. Ainsi, après le Cercle, la séquence devrait revenir au **Losange**.\n\nEn combinant ces deux motifs, le prochain élément de la séquence devrait être un **Losange Blanc**.\n\n*   **Option 1 (Triangle blanc centré)** correspond à la couleur correcte mais introduit une nouvelle forme (Triangle) sans une règle de progression claire (par exemple, nombre de côtés : 4, 4, 0/infini, 3 n'est pas une suite simple).\n*   **Option 2 (Losange blanc centré)** correspond à la couleur correcte et suit une logique de cycle pour les formes (Losange, Carré, Cercle, Losange...).

Dans l'option 1, la virgule avant 'et' est donc incorrecte. L'option 2 utilise correctement la virgule pour séparer les éléments d'une énumération. L'option 3 est incorrecte car elle utilise un point-virgule de manière inappropriée après une virgule.",
      "WRONG_ANSWER (Gemini): Analyse des options :\n1.  'Il est venu, et a pris son sac.' : L'usage de la virgule avant 'et' est généralement incorrect lorsque 'et' relie deux verbes ou deux propositions ayant le même sujet et étant de courte longueur. La virgule est superflue ici.\n2.  'Il n’est ni mon père, ni mon frère, ni mon oncle.' : L'usage de la virgule est correct ici. Lorsque 'ni' est répété pour énumérer plusieurs éléments, les virgules sont utilisées pour séparer ces éléments, de la même manière que dans une énumération classique.\n3.  'Fatiguée, elle est ; très malade.' : L'usage du point-virgule est incorrect. Un point-virgule sépare des propositions indépendantes mais liées par le sens, ou des éléments complexes dans une énumération. Ici, 'très malade' n'est pas une proposition indépendante et ne peut être séparé ainsi. La phrase est mal construite.\n\nConclusion : Seule l'option 2 présente un usage correct de la virgule selon les règles de la grammaire française.
