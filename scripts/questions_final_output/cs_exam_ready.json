In the subjunctive, the verb takes the base form (increase) regardless of the subject (the government). This contrasts with the indicative mood, which would require 'increases' after 'government' (a singular noun).",

Option A, while grammatically correct, lacks the strong emphasis provided by the inversion.

      "correct_text": "equitably distribute",
      "explanation": "The most appropriate and idiomatic choice in this context is \"equitably distribute\". \n\n*   **\"Equitably distribute\"**: \"Equitably\" means fairly and justly, directly aligning with the program's goal of ensuring all communities benefit from prosperity. \"Distribute\" refers to the act of spreading or dividing something among a group, which perfectly describes how a government program would spread economic dividends across regions. The phrase \"equitable distribution of wealth/benefits\" is a widely recognized collocation in economic and policy discourse.\n\n*   **\"Impartially share\"**: While \"impartially\" means without bias, it emphasizes the *process* of sharing rather than the *outcome* of fairness across diverse groups. \"Equitably\" more directly addresses the fairness of the outcome, which is the primary aim. Furthermore, \"share\" is slightly less formal than \"distribute\" in the context of governmental policy regarding economic dividends.\n\n*   **\"Justly apportion\"**: \"Apportion\" implies dividing something into specific, assigned shares or portions, often according to a plan or ratio. While not inherently incorrect, \"distribute\" conveys a broader spreading of benefits throughout regions more naturally than \"apportion\" in this general context of ensuring widespread participation in prosperity. \"Equitably distribute\" is a more common and natural collocation for broad-based economic programs.",

La « multiple désignation » (A) rompt explicitement avec la désignation unique et permet à un État de désigner plusieurs transporteurs pour opérer des services intra-africains. En revanche, le cabotage intérieur (B) — 9e liberté — n’est pas accordé par la Décision. De même, la 7e liberté passagers généralisée (C) n’y figure pas, la Décision se concentrant notamment sur l’octroi de droits jusqu’à la 5e liberté dans un cadre encadré. Enfin, l’abolition totale et immédiate des régimes tarifaires et des exigences de sécurité (D) est contraire à l’esprit du texte, qui maintient des garde-fous réglementaires et de sûreté tout en allégeant les contraintes commerciales. La difficulté réside dans la distinction fine entre les libertés de l’air et la portée juridique précise de la « multiple désignation », souvent confondue avec une libéralisation sans limites.",

On sait que : \n\n*   3 pagnes peuvent être échangés contre 5 ananas.\n*   2 ananas peuvent être échangés contre 3 mangues.\n\nSi Awa souhaite obtenir 27 mangues, combien de pagnes doit-elle apporter au marché ?",

Ensuite, on détermine combien de pagnes sont nécessaires pour 18 ananas. Puisque 3 pagnes valent 5 ananas, pour 18 ananas, il faut (18/5) * 3 = 10.8 pagnes. Comme Awa ne peut pas échanger une fraction de pagne, elle doit échanger la quantité entière immédiatement supérieure pour être sûre d'obtenir les 27 mangues. En réalité, on doit multiplier 3 pagnes par 18 (ananas) divisé par 5 (ananas) soit (3*18)/5 = 10.8, puis trouver le multiple de 3 qui couvre la demande d'ananas, soit 12 pagnes.  L'opération logique est de faire une règle de trois inversée : (27 mangues / 3 mangues) * 2 ananas = 18 ananas. (18 ananas / 5 ananas) * 3 pagnes = 10.8 pagnes. Puisque le nombre de pagnes doit être un entier et qu'on ne peut pas avoir une fraction de pagne, on regarde le nombre de pagnes le plus proche supérieur à 10.8 qu'on peut diviser par 3. Il s'agit de 12 pagnes, car 12/3 = 4 lots de 3 pagnes.",

D'autre part, ce nombre égale la somme des tailles des équipes : 12 + 15 + 18 + 21 = 66. Donc 2N = 66, ce qui donne N = 33. Vérifions avec les intersections : il y a C(4,2) = 6 paires d'équipes, chacune avec 6 employés communs, soit 6 × 6 = 36 doubles comptages. Par inclusion-exclusion : |A∪B∪C∪D| = 66 - 36 = 30. Mais cette formule compte chaque employé une seule fois, alors qu'en réalité chaque employé est dans 2 équipes. Le vrai nombre d'employés est donc bien 33, car 33 × 2 - 36 = 30 (où 30 représente le nombre d'appartenances uniques après correction des doubles comptages).",

Soit (4 + 2) * 3 = 6 * 3 = 18.\n\n2.  **6 ◆ 3 = 45**\n    En appliquant une logique similaire, 45 est le résultat de (6 + 3) multiplié par 5. Soit (6 + 3) * 5 = 9 * 5 = 45.\n\nNous avons donc deux opérations : (A + B) * 3 et (A + B) * 5.\nLa clé est de trouver le motif dans les multiplicateurs (3 et 5). Ces nombres sont des nombres impairs consécutifs à partir de 3.\n\nEn suivant cette logique, le prochain multiplicateur dans la séquence des nombres impairs serait 7.\n\nPour **7 ◆ 4** :\nOn applique la même structure : (7 + 4) * (multiplicateur suivant)\nLe multiplicateur suivant est 7.\nDonc, (7 + 4) * 7 = 11 * 7 = 77.\n\nLa valeur de 7 ◆ 4 est 77.",

      "correct_text": "Les transactions dont les montants sont des nombres premiers suivis de la séquence '225'.",
      "explanation": "La réponse A est correcte car l'utilisation de nombres premiers suivis d'une séquence spécifique ('225', qui est l'indicatif téléphonique de la Côte d'Ivoire) est un motif complexe et non aléatoire, souvent utilisé pour masquer des transactions frauduleuses. Les nombres premiers sont difficiles à détecter sans une analyse approfondie, ce qui augmente la complexité de la reconnaissance du motif. Les autres options, bien que plausibles, ne présentent pas le même niveau de complexité algorithmique et de spécificité contextuelle.",

Les options fournies ne sont pas directement liées à une méthode spécifique de reconnaissance de motifs, et il n'est pas évident comment elles se rapportent à la question posée.
