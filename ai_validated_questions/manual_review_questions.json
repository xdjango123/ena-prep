Choosing B (Jacques), a person not mentioned in the premise at all, most clearly signals the irrelevance and insufficiency of the given information. It avoids making an unfounded assumption about Marc or Pierre's age based on their wealth, which would be implied by choosing A or C.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "L'option correcte est B) 'Put out'.\n\nLe verbe à particule 'put out' a plusieurs significations, dont 'publier' ou 'distribuer' des informations. Dans le contexte d'une réunion, l'expression 'They had to put out the meeting' peut être interprétée comme 'Ils devaient publier ou distribuer les informations relatives à la réunion' (par exemple, l'ordre du jour, les minutes, l'annonce de la réunion). C'est une utilisation courante où l'événement ('the meeting') est employé par métonymie pour désigner les documents ou informations le concernant.\n\nAnalysons les autres options :\nA) 'Call out'. Le verbe à particule 'call out' signifie généralement 'interpeller', 'appeler à haute voix', 'dénoncer' ou 'remettre en question'. Il ne signifie PAS 'annuler' ou 'reporter' une réunion. Le verbe à particule pour annuler une réunion est 'call off', et pour reporter est 'put off'. Par conséquent, 'call out the meeting' est incorrect dans ce contexte.\n\nC) 'Break out'. Le verbe à particule 'break out' signifie généralement 's'échapper' (d'une prison), 'éclater' (pour une guerre, une épidémie ou une éruption cutanée), ou 'commencer à utiliser' quelque chose qui était auparavant rangé (par exemple, 'break out the champagne'). L'interprétation de 'séparer ou diviser la réunion en petits groupes' comme le suggère Claude n'est pas une utilisation idiomatique ou standard de 'break out the meeting'. On dirait plutôt 'break the meeting up' (pour la terminer ou la diviser) ou 'break into smaller groups' (pour se diviser en groupes). 'Break out the meeting' pour signifier 'démarrer la réunion' est très peu courant et non standard.\n\nEn comparaison, 'put out' (distribuer de l'information) est la seule option qui offre une interprétation plausible et idiomatique dans le contexte donné.",
      "confidence_score": 9,
      "agrees_with_gpt5": false,
      "agrees_with_claude": false,
      "reasoning": "GPT-5 incorrectly defines 'call out' as meaning to cancel or postpone a meeting; the correct phrasal verb for this is 'call off'. Therefore, option A is incorrect. Claude's explanation for 'break out' as meaning to 'separate or divide into smaller groups' is grammatically awkward for 'break out the meeting'; the more appropriate phrasal verb would be 'break up' the meeting or 'break into' smaller groups. Therefore, option C is also incorrect or at best a highly strained interpretation.\n\nOption B, 'put out', is the most plausible. 'Put out' commonly means to publish or distribute information. In the context of 'the meeting', it's a common metonymic usage where 'the meeting' refers to the information related to the meeting (e.g., agenda, minutes, announcement). For instance, 'They had to put out the meeting agenda' or 'They had to put out a notice about the meeting'. This interpretation makes 'put out the meeting' a valid and logical choice, implying the distribution of meeting-related materials or announcements."

Calculons la somme des nombres connus :\n    14 + 18 + 22 + 26 = 80\n\n2.  Substituons cette somme dans l'équation :\n    (80 + x) / 5 = 22\n\n3.

Résolvons pour x :\n    x = 110 - 80\n    x = 30\n\nLe nombre correct pour que la moyenne soit 22 est 30.\n\nDe plus, si nous observons la suite numérique (14, 18, 22, 26, ?), nous remarquons un motif arithmétique où chaque nombre augmente de 4 par rapport au précédent :\n14 (+4) = 18\n18 (+4) = 22\n22 (+4) = 26\nEn suivant ce motif, le nombre suivant serait 26 (+4) = 30.\n\nLes deux méthodes (calcul de la moyenne et identification du motif) mènent au même résultat : 30.\n\nCependant, la valeur 30 n'est pas proposée parmi les options (A: 32, B: 34, C: 36). Cela indique que la question est intrinsèquement imparfaite ou que les options sont incorrectes. En tant qu'expert en validation de contenu éducatif, il est important de signaler cette anomalie.\n\nSi l'on est contraint de choisir parmi les options données malgré cette anomalie, la pratique courante dans ce type de situation est de sélectionner l'option numériquement la plus proche de la réponse calculée (30).\n\nComparons les options à 30 :\n*   A) 32 : Différence = |32 - 30| = 2\n*   B) 34 : Différence = |34 - 30| = 4\n*   C) 36 : Différence = |36 - 30| = 6\n\nL'option A (32) est numériquement la plus proche de 30.",

This is verified by independently observing the arithmetic progression in the given numbers (14, 18, 22, 26, ?) which also indicates the next number should be 30.\n2.  **Flawed Question:** Since the calculated correct answer (30) is not present in the options (A: 32, B: 34, C: 36), the question is flawed. When forced to choose an answer from a flawed multiple-choice set, the most logical heuristic is to select the option that is numerically closest to the correctly calculated answer. Option A (32) is closest to 30.\n\nGPT-5 correctly calculated 30 but then made an illogical leap to option B (34) based on a misinterpretation of 'the next logical number based on the pattern of increase by 4'. The next logical number *in the sequence* is 30, not 34.\nClaude also correctly calculated 30 and identified the pattern, but then introduced a contradictory and incorrect step ('30 → 36 (+4)') to arrive at option C (36), which is logically unsound."

Let P be the initial price. After a 25% increase, the price becomes P * (1 + 0.25) = 1.25P. This new price then decreases by 20%. So, the final price is (1.25P) * (1 - 0.20) = 1.25P * 0.80.
