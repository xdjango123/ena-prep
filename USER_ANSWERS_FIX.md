# User Answers Saving Fix

## 🐛 **Issue**
User responses were not being saved when taking the exam, showing "Pas de réponse" (No answer) in the review page.

## ✅ **Root Cause & Fix**

### **Problem**: User answers saving was disabled
I had temporarily disabled user answers saving to focus on the score update issue.

### **Fix**: Re-enabled user answers saving
```typescript
// In examResultService.ts - saveExamResult method
if (userAnswers) {
  try {
    const { UserAttemptService } = await import('./userAttemptService');
    
    // Convert Map to array format expected by UserAttemptService
    const userAnswersArray: [number, string | number][] = [];
    userAnswers.forEach((answer, questionId) => {
      userAnswersArray.push([parseInt(questionId), answer]);
    });
    
    console.log('💾 Saving user answers:', userAnswersArray.length, 'answers');
    
    await UserAttemptService.saveUserAttempt(
      userId,
      'examen_blanc',
      'OVERALL',
      undefined,
      examNumber,
      overallScore,
      {
        questions: [],
        userAnswers: userAnswersArray,
        correctAnswers: Math.round((overallScore / 100) * userAnswers.size),
        totalQuestions: userAnswers.size,
        timeSpent: 0
      }
    );
    
    console.log('✅ User answers saved successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('❌ Error saving user answers:', error);
  }
}
```
