# Debug Retake Fix - Comprehensive Testing

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Answer Saving Bug**
**Problem**: User answers weren't being saved when clicking "Next" on the last question
**Fix**: Added answer saving in `handleNextQuestion` before finishing exam

```typescript
const handleNextQuestion = () => {
  // Save current answer before moving
  if (selectedAnswer) {
    setUserAnswers(prev => new Map(prev).set(questions[currentQuestionIndex].id, selectedAnswer));
  }
  
  if (currentQuestionIndex < questions.length - 1) {
    // Move to next question
  } else {
    // Finish exam
  }
};
```

### 2. ✅ **Enhanced Debugging**
**Added comprehensive console logging:**
- `🔘 Terminer button clicked` - when finish button is clicked
- `🏁 Reached last question, finishing exam...` - when auto-finishing
- `🎯 handleFinishExam called` - when exam finishes
- `📊 User answers collected: X/60` - shows answer count
- `📊 User answers: [...]` - shows first 5 answers
- `💾 Save result: SUCCESS/FAILED` - save result
- `📝 Data to insert: {...}` - database insert data
- `❌ Error details: {...}` - detailed error info

### 3. ✅ **Error Handling**
**Added try-catch blocks:**
- Around `saveExamResult` call
- Detailed error logging with JSON.stringify
