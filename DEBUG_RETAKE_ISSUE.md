# Debug Retake Issue - Score Not Updating

## Problem
When retaking Examen Blanc #1, the score remains at 2% instead of updating to the new score (20%).

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue is that the `saveExamResult` function in the frontend isn't being called or is failing silently when the exam finishes.

## Debugging Steps Taken

### 1. ✅ Database Test
- **Manually updated database** with 20% score
- **Verified update works** - exam page now shows 20%
- **Confirmed issue is in frontend** - not database

### 2. ✅ Added Console Logging
**Files Updated:**
- `src/components/quiz/SecureExamInterface.tsx`
- `src/services/examResultService.ts`

**Debug Points Added:**
- `🎯 handleFinishExam called` - when exam finishes
- `💾 Saving exam result to database...` - when starting save
- `📊 Calculated score: X%` - shows calculated score
- `💾 Saving to database: user=X, examType=Y, examNumber=Z, score=X` - save parameters
- `💾 Save result: SUCCESS/FAILED` - save result
- `📝 Inserting exam results: X records` - database insert
- `✅ Successfully saved exam results` - success confirmation

### 3. ✅ Simplified User Answers
- **Temporarily disabled** user answers saving to focus on score update
- **Removed complex UserAttemptService** integration
- **Focused on basic score saving** first

## Next Steps for Testing

### Test the Retake Flow:
1. **Open browser console** (F12 → Console tab)
2. **Retake Examen Blanc #1** - click "Refaire"
3. **Complete the exam** - answer some questions
4. **Let it finish** - wait for completion screen
5. **Check console logs** - look for the debug messages above
6. **Return to exam page** - check if score updates

### Expected Console Output:
```
🎯 handleFinishExam called
💾 Saving exam result to database...
📊 Calculated score: 20% (12/60 correct)
💾 Saving to database: user=xxx, examType=CS, examNumber=1, score=20
📝 Inserting exam results: 4 records
✅ Successfully saved exam results: [...]
💾 Save result: SUCCESS
```

### If No Console Output:
- The exam isn't finishing properly
- `handleFinishExam` isn't being called
- Check if exam completion logic is working

### If Console Shows Errors:
- Database connection issue
- Permission issue
- Data format issue

## Current Status
- ✅ Database update works (manually tested)
- ✅ Console logging added
- ✅ User answers temporarily disabled
- 🔄 **Ready for user testing with console logs**

The debug logs will help identify exactly where the issue is occurring in the retake flow.
